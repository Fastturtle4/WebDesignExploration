		<p> Discovered in 1868, <strong>Cro-Magnon 1</strong> was among the first fossils to be recognized as belonging to our own speciesâ€”Homo sapiens. This famous fossil skull is from one of several modern human skeletons found at the famous rock shelter site at Cro-Magnon, near the village of Les Eyzies, France. </p>
		<p>Road construction in 1868 revealed the rock shelter tucked into a limestone cliff. Researchers recognized an occupation floor toward the back of the cave during excavations. The occupation area revealed the remains of four adult skeletons, one infant, and some fragmentary bones. The condition and placement of ornaments, including pieces of shell and animal teeth fashioned into what appear to be pendants or necklaces, led researchers to believe the skeletons had been intentionally buried within the shelter in a single grave. The site was one of the first to establish the ancient roots of modern humans, and fossils from this shelter represent some of the oldest Homo sapiens populations of Europe. Associated tools and fragments of fossil animal bone date the site to the uppermost Pleistocene, probably between 32,000 and 30,000 years old.</p>
